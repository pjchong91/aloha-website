# Aloha Project

Task: Create a homepage for Aloha Apparel Co.
Using: HtmL, CSS, JS, flexbox(?)

Learning acquired:
- It's a good idea to just include meta charset utf-8 automatically.  It otherwise will not process properly on certain browsers
- You can leave comments after the end of a div so that you are clear on what is being closed.
- CTRL+ / = Comment shorthand
- Transfonter helps with making fonts readily available for other browsers. Remember to adjust the url so that it points to the correct directory

Q: What is flexbox? - *Create responsive layout with flexbox*
Q: '16px for all screen width 600px and up'... and what about smaller? can it still be 16px?
Q: git respository initialized in its root directory with an appropriately customize .gitignore file
Q: push assignment to GitHub - with all commits synced to it
Q: What are essential elements?
Q: What is a CSS reset? 
    Removes default CSS elements.  Place it before your own CSS.  This should be done on all projects.

    ** IS MY RESET NOT WORKING?? 8px margin around whole body.
Q: Probably want to scale down pictures to fit better in mobile??

** VALIDATE HTML AND CSS
