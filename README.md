# Project 01 - Aloha Webpage

## Task: Create a homepage for Aloha Apparel Co.
Using: HtmL, CSS, and Javascript

## Major Questions Encountered:
* Q: What is flexbox and how is it used?
    - Containers can be turned into a flexbox with property "display: flex".  Subsequent properties can then be applied to the flexbox to organize child elements within the box.

* Q: How do you create a reactive web design (RWD)?
    - By creating various width breakpoints in the page using @media, different CSS can be applied to the page depending on page width.

 * Q: What is the purpose of GitHub?
    - To create checkpoints of project progression as different elements become functional.  Progress can be reverted to a previous 'Git Push' if new changes significantly break the project.

* Q: What is a CSS reset and why do we use it?
    - CSS resets remove pre-set properties that a browser may apply to an element in the case that no previous property has been specified.  For example: an 'h1' may have a pre-set font-size and font-weight on Chrome that will be applied if there are no specifications provided by the developer's CSS.


## Misc. Learning acquired:
- It's a good idea to just include meta charset utf-8 automatically.  It otherwise will not process properly on certain browsers
- You can leave comments after the end of a div so that you are clear on what is being closed.
- CTRL+ / = Comment shorthand
- Transfonter helps with making fonts readily available for other browsers. Remember to adjust the url so that it points to the correct directory
